## Overview
This React app displays a few tidbits of very important information, such as certain animal 
species'natural biomes and color, and also certain food items' meal and description. 
This info is shown in cards on the page and your objective is to get the selector element working
 to translate these cards into other languages.

### Step 1
In `src/App.js`, hook up the `onChange` function on the `<select>` element to mutate a piece of 
state on the component. It should have a default state of selecting English. Please note that
 `App` is a React _function_ component. If you have seen or used _class_ components and the
  `setState` method, those will not work here! You can read up on the more modern 
  [React Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) 
  if you are unfamiliar with this pattern.

### Step 2
You must write the function `createTranslate` without changing any other code in the file. 
(Moving things is fine, don't change method invocations or signatures).

The function can be found in `src/App.js`.

The [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) library is already imported to `App.js` and may make writing the
 function easier. [This reference](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use)
  for Ramda may also prove useful. All functions are accessible like so: `R.map`. It is perfectly
   okay if you want to try doing this step using another utility library such as Lodash or 
   Underscore, or with plain javascript.

When the function is correctly implemented `yarn start` should run the app and you should see two
 rows of divs with text content. Selecting a language from the dropdown menu at the top should 
 change the text content to that language.

### Step 3
Add type comments for all declarations. Please use something approximating 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 syntax or Haskell/Elm/etc. if that's more comfortable for you. 
 The purpose of this exercise is just to demonstrate your ability to 
 spell out parameter and return types, not that you know TypeScript specifics.
  Abbreviating a React component param or return value to `ReactComponent` is perfectly fine.

Ex:
```
// int, int -> bool
(x, y) => x > y;

// int, int -> (int -> string)
(x, y) => {
  return (z) => z + "!"
}
```

### *Bonus Step 4*
DISCLAIMER: You can complete and successfully pass this task without completing this step at all. 
This is just an opportunity for you to demonstrate knowledge of styling and CSS.
The design team was on vacation when we first styled this app. After reviewing, 
they would like the Card component  backgrounds to alternate between the `rebeccapurple` color 
and `lightgreen`, meaning the first card in the row should be purple, 
the second card would be green, etc. Update `src/App.styled.js` to achieve this. 

For reference, this file implements the 
[`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started) library.
